# Working example Ceramic + React + Typescript

This is a basic example of how to have basic interaction with Ceramic Network Testnet (https://ceramic-clay.3boxlabs.com).

This React app allows you to:

- create and authenticate a DID
- write to a document in family "HOPR Logs"
- update the document with a custom String content

Every time you'll authenticate again, the same Document will be loaded and logged in the console.
Every time you update or fetch document, the action will be loaded in the console.

## Installation

`yarn`

## Run the app

`yarn start`
